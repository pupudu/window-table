# WindowTable

Let's go through all the props accepted by the `WindowTable` component.

Note: In addition to the props documented here, all basic props such as
`className`, `style`, `key` and all the props from the react-window itself
can be supplied.  

## **data**: Array
This should be an array of objects(`key`-`value` pairs); each object representing
a single row of the table. The `key` will be picked up by the `columns`
prop, to render the `value` of each pair. 

Example data:
```jsx harmony
const data = [
  {name: 'Naruto', age: 24, clan: 'Uzomaki'},
  {name: 'Hinata', age: 22, clan: 'Huga'},
  {name: 'Itachi', age: 28, clan: 'Uchiha'},
  //...and thousands or millions of data
];
```

## **columns**: Array
This should be an array of objects as described below.
The number of objects in the array will be the number of
columns rendered by the table, and the order they are
rendered. This also means, that
the number of columns rendered by the table are somewhat independent
of the format of the data supplied. It is this prop that
controls it.

Each object in the columns array can have the following 
attributes.

### `key`: String
This maps an item in a data row to a column. 

Suppose we feed the table with the example data from the `data` prop section above.

Now, if we have a column object with the key `name`, it will
render the names, "Naruto", "Hinata" and "Itachi" in three rows.

```jsx harmony
const columns = [
  {key: 'name', /*...more attributes*/},
  // ... more columns
];
```

Note: If the `key` does not match a value in the data, it will render
nothing by default. However, you can pass a custom `Component`
to render something useful based on the `column` and `row`. 
See the `Component` attribute for more details.

### `width`: Number
The pixel value of this value will be used as the base width of the
column. 

However, the actual column widths grow if the table width
is greater than the total column width.

For example, if we have 3 columns, each specified as width: 100,
and the table width is 450 pixels, the extra 150 pixels will be
divided among the three columns, making them 150 pixels each.

This behavior is achieved by setting the flex-grow property internally.

### `title`: String
This is the column title. Header cells can be customized using the 
`HeaderCell` attribute. 

### `Component`: React.Component
You can customize the column cells by supplying a custom React Component
for this attribute. The component can accept 4 props: `children`, `column`, `row` and `index`.

* `children`: A single data unit from the `data` array. Can be derived from the `row` and `column` as `row[column.key]`
* `column`: The `column` itself
* `row`: A data row from the data array
* `index`: Index of the row being rendered

```jsx harmony
const columns = [
  {key: 'ability', width: 100, Component: AbilityRenderer}
];

const AbilityRenderer = props => {
  const {children, row, column} = props;
  return ( 
    <div>
      {/*Something based on children, row and column*/}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `HeaderCell`: React.Component
Similar to the `Component` above, the HeaderCell attribute can be used
to customize the header cells. The component supplied to this attribute
can accept two props: `children` and `column`.

* `children`: The value of the `title` attribute in the column metadata
* `column`: The column itself


## **Height**: Number | **Width**: Number
We measure the dimensions of the table based on the parent container
and the styles applied on the table itself. However, you can also
supply explicit values for the width and height attributes.

This will result in the table not having to measure, giving a 
performance boost. However, it will stop the table from adjusting its 
content based on the window size or window resize events.


## **rowHeight**: Number|Function
Similar to how we can supply explicit values for the table width and height,
we can also supply an explicit value for a rowHeight. 

We can also supply a function which accepts the row index of the data array
that's being rendered. This can be useful for changing the row height
based on each row content. Nonetheless, how you measure the height based on the content 
can be tricky. 


## **sampleRow**: Object
By default, the height of a row in the table is determined by measuring the
row rendered by the first data row. In cases where you customize what is being
rendered in columns, this behavior may not be ideal.

There can be instances where the first data row cannot represent the whole
data array. In such cases, you can pass a sample row of data, which will
be used internally to measure the content.

The sampleRow should take the exact same form as a typical row of data from the
data array.


## **sampleRowIndex**: Number
In case you know the index, you can pass this index instead of supplying
a sample data row as mentioned above in `sampleRow` prop.


## **classNamePrefix**: String
All important elements will be given a className by the window-table.
These classes can be used for styling the table with CSS.

However, there can be cases where some other library, or component has the 
same classes. In such cases, you can supply a prefix string, which will
be prepended to all the classNames used by window-table.


## **rowClassName**: String | Function
When a string is provided, it will be concatenated with the 
classNamePrefix and will be applied to the table rows.

When a Function is provided, it will be called with the index
of the row that is being rendered. The return value of that
function should be a string, which will be applied to the 
tableRows as the className, concatenated with the classNamePrefix. 

For instance, imagine we want to have different classNames for
odd and even rows:
```jsx harmony
<WindowTable 
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowClassName={index => index % 2 === 0 ? 'even-row' : 'odd-row'}
/>
```

## **overscanCount**: Number
This is the same `overscanCount` prop from react-window, serving the same purpose.


## **Cell**: React.Component
By default, each table cell will be rendered using a `div`. 
You can change this behavior by supplying a custom React Component
or a primitive like `td`.


## **HeaderCell**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Header Cells. 
Think of it as a `th` primitive.


## **Table**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Table. 
Think of it as a `table` primitive.


## **Header**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Table Header. 
Think of it as a `thead` primitive.


## **HeaderRow**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Header Row. 
Think of it as a `tr` primitive, nested inside a `thead`.


## **Body**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Table Body.
Think of it as a `tbody` primitive.


## **Row**: React.Component
Same as `Cell`, but for the Table Rows.
Think of it as a `tr` primitive, nested inside a `tbody`.
