# Utility Functions

## **useDebouncedState**
This is a slight variation of React's useState hook.

```
const [state, debouncedState, setState] = useDebouncedState(initialState, wait);
```

### **Arguments:**

### `initialState`: any
Same as the initialState of the `useState` hook

### `wait`: number (default = 50)
The debounce wait value in milliseconds.

### **Return Values Array:**

### `state`: any
Same as the `state` from the `useState` hook

### `debouncedState`: any
Similar to state, except, this will be updated at most once per every `wait` milliseconds.

For example, if you call `setState`, 3 times(with values 'foo', 'bar', and 'baz') within 50 milliseconds,
* state will get all three values: 'foo', 'bar', and 'baz'
* debouncedState will get only `baz`

### `setState`: Function
Same as the `setState` from the `useState` hook

## **useFilter**
This hook does two simple things

1. Return the original data list when the `filterText` is empty
1. Memoize the search results for fast updates

```jsx harmony
const filteredData = useFilter(filterFn, data, filterText);
```

as shown above, it accepts 3 arguments,

### `filterFn`: Function
The filter function should take the following form,

```jsx harmony
function filterFn(data, filterText) {
  // filter logic
  return filteredData;
}
```

### `data`: Array
Original data array to be filtered.

### `filterText`: string
Search text to base the filtering on.

The key idea here is that, the `filterFn` function will be
called internally with the `data` and `filterText` search
string in an optimal manner. 

## **createFilter**

Given a list of attributes, return a function which will filter data
based on those attributes.

It takes the following form:

```
const filterFn = createFilter(attributes);
```

### `attributes`: string[]
Object keys to base the filtering on.

### `filterFn`: Function
A function which can filter data given a search text.
More about this function can be found after the following example.

Suppose we have a data set as follows,
```
const dataList = [
  { name: 'Paolo', profession: 'Software Engineer', company: 'hipages'},
  { name: 'Ayesha', profession: 'Flight Dispatcher', company: 'SL Airlines'},
  { name: 'Daham', profession: 'Tech Lead', company: 'Sysco Labs'},
  // ...
]
```

And we create a filter function which can filter data based on `name` and `profession`
```
const filterFn = createFilter(['name', 'profession']);
```

Now if we supply the dataList to this function, along with some text,
we will get the following results

```
// Returns row #3
filterFn(dataList, 'Daham');

// Returns rows #1 and #2 since it matches: "Engineer" and "Dispatcher"
filterFn(dataList, 'er');

// Returns rows #1 and #2 since it matches: "Paolo" and "Dispatcher"
filterFn(dataList, 'pa');

// Doesn't yield any rows, as we didn't add `company` to the filter list
filterFn(dataList, 'Sysco Labs');
```

###

The filter function returned from the createFilter function takes two arguments,
and returns an array of filtered data

```
const filteredData = filterFn(dataList, filterText);
```

### `dataList`: array
Original object array to be filtered.

### `filterText`: string
Search text to base the filtering on.

### `filteredData`: array
Similar structure to `dataList`, just with fewer entries.
