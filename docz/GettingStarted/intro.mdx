# Window-Table

Window Table is a fixed data table for React, which
is capable of rendering thousands of rows of data
without compromising performance.

Let's render a table with **100,000** rows of data.
Scroll as fast as you can!

<ShinobiTable />

Now Let's have a quick look at the code we needed for the above demo.
Note that we are using bootstrap 
[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/) table classes for styling.
```jsx harmony
<Html5Table
    data={data}
    columns={columns}
    className="table-sm table-striped"
    headerClassName="thead-dark"
/>
```

## Blazing Fast 💨

Window Tables uses the awesome React Window library
for virtualizing the content. Thanks to that, we are
able to lazily render rows, as if they were always there.

## Tiny Footprint 👶

The code for this library is written in a way
which minimizes the lines of code
while still allowing the users to customize and extend
it however they want. 
**This resulted in the library to be less than 2KB in size.**

## HTML5 tags 💅

One of the biggest pain points in using a fixed data table
is styling. In contrast, basic HTML5 tags based tables
can be easily styled using an off the shelf style system
like bootstrap.

Thus you can optionally use default HTML 5 tags like `table`,
`thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td` and `th` for the table
nodes by importing the `HTML5Table` component from this
library.

```jsx harmony
import { Html5Table } from 'window-table';
```

## Production Ready 💪

This library is a product of **Hipages, Australia**; The no.1
place to hire tradies in Australia.

This also means that this library runs in production
in a leading technology company. Thus you can always
expect fast turnaround for questions, issues, feature requests
and even bug fixes.
